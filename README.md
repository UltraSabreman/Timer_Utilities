## What's This?

This is a started out as a way for me to learn C# and windows form programming, but had turned into a fully-fledged time management app. 

It's major "selling" point will be its ability to never stop nagging you (just like your mom [heh]).

## What's Coming?
All the core features and systems are done and ready, here's my to-do list for the future:
<pre>
	[] Add reminder functionality to the calendar.
	[] Tons of UI Tweeks.
	[] An opgl (or winform if im feeling crazy) event viewer.
	[] A seperate build without the calendar and with an alarm tab instead
</pre>

Other then these things I'll be doing w/e I feel like. Honestly once I finish with the first two items,
I think this thing will be "done", but we'll see how I feel later.
