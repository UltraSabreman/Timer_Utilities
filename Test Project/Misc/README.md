## What's This?

This is a started out as a way for me to learn C# and windows form programming, but had turned into a a fun little utility

I've decided to make a big change, I'm removing the calednar functionality (because lets face it, no one will ever use it)
and instead adding things like a notes page and maybie an alarms page.

## What's Coming?
All the core features and systems are done and ready, here's my to-do list for the future:
<pre>
	[] Tons of UI Tweeks.
	[] No Idea.
</pre>

Other then these things I'll be doing w/e I feel like. Honestly once I finish with the first two items,
I think this thing will be "done", but we'll see how I feel later.
